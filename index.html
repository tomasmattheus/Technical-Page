                <h2>Try React</h2>
                <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.</p>
                <h2>Online Playgrounds </h2>
                <p>If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.

                <p>React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to an existing page. React components are a great way to do that.</p>
                <p>The majority of websites aren’t, and don’t need to be, single-page apps. With a few lines of code and no build tooling, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.</p>

                <h2>Add React in One Minute</h2>

                <p>In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can follow along with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice.</p>
                <p>There will be no complicated tools or install requirements — <strong> complete this section, you only need an internet connection, and a minute of your time.</strong></p>

                <p>Optional: <a href="https://gist.github.com/gaearon/6668a1f6986742109c00a581ce704605/archive/87f0b6f34238595b44308acfb86df6ea43669c08.zip" target="_blank">Download the full example(2KB zipped).</a>
            
                <h3>Step 1: Add a DOM container to the HTML</h3>
                <p>First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty <div> tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with React. For example:</p>
                <div class="code">
                    <pre class="pre_code">
                    <span class="comment">&lt;!-- ... existing HTML ... --></span>
                        <code>
                            <span class="highlighted">&lt;div id="like_button_container"&gt;&lt;/div></span>
                        </code>
                    <span class="comment"> &lt;!-- ... existing HTML ... --></span>
                    </pre>
                </div>
                <p>We gave this <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> a unique <code>id</code> HTML attribute. This will allow us to find it from the JavaScript code later and display a React component inside of it.</p>
                
                <div class="tip">
                    <h4>Tip</h4>
                    <p>You can place a “container” <code>&lt;div></code> like this anywhere inside the <code>&lt;body></code> tag. You may have as many independent DOM containers on one page as you need. They are usually empty — React will replace any existing content inside DOM containers.</p>
                </div>

                <h3>Step 2: Add the Script Tags</h3>
                <p>Next, add three <code>&lt;script></code> tags to the HTML page right before the closing <code>&lt;/body></code> tag:</p>

            <p>This page describes a few popular React toolchains which help with tasks like:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li class="item_lista">Scaling to many files and components.</li>
                <li class="item_lista">Using third-party libraries from npm.</li>

                <li class="item_lista">Optimizing the output for production.</li>
            </ul>

               Release channels

                <p class="subtitle">React relies on a thriving open source community to file bug reports, open pull requests, and submit RFCs. To encourage feedback we sometimes share special builds of React that include unreleased features.</p>

                <strong> This document will be most relevant to developers who work on frameworks, libraries, or developer tooling. Developers who use React primarily to build user-facing applications should not need to worry about our prerelease channels.</strong>

            <p>Each of React’s release channels is designed for a distinct use case:</p>
        
            <ul>
                <li class="item_lista"><strong>Latest</strong> is for stable, semver React releases. It’s what you get when you install React from npm. This is the channel you’re already using today. <strong>Use this for all user-facing React applications.</strong></li>
                <li class="item_lista"><strong>Next</strong> tracks the main branch of the React source code repository. Think of these as release candidates for the next minor semver release. Use this for integration testing between React and third party projects.</li>
                <li class="item_lista"><strong>Experimental</strong> includes experimental APIs and features that aren’t available in the stable releases. These also track the main branch, but with additional feature flags turned on. Use this to try out upcoming features before they are released.</li>
